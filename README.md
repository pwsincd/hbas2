# hbas Web Front End.
This a Project to develop hbas further , to include but not limited to a new design , with categories , search , and functionality similar to the google play store , only for the wiiu homebrew.

Utilises the https://vuejs.org/ framework. Implemented by https://github.com/jaames .

"Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries."

Hbas web front end relies on the directory.json file generated by vgmoose's pythob script. Found here : https://github.com/vgmoose/hbas/blob/master/web/gen.py
